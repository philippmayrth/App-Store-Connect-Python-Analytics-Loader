# Timezones
This framework does its best to handle timezones. However there are limits, mainly because Apple does not tell us the timezones of the dates its more of a educated guess.

# About AppleÂ´s Reporter.jar
This should also run on PC (everything with a Java runtime)

# Troubleshooting
**Error:** ```AppStoreConnectReporterErrors.AmbiguousAccountNumber: You have access to more than one account. Please specify an account number in your properties file or on the command line. To see a list of accounts, run the command getAccounts.```
**Solution:**
  - Run the command ```java -jar Reporter.jar p=Reporter.properties Sales.getAccounts```
  - You should see a list of all the accounts you have access to now
  - Take the number/id after the comma of the account relevant to you and place it in the ```Reporter.properties``` file in the line that says ```Account=```.

**Sugestion:** *If you need to import the statistics of multiple accounts you have access to you can simply deploy this ETL script into several directories each with a uniqe ```Reporter.properties``` file.*
